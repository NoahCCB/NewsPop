Creative Portion:
For the creatice portion of this project we implemented a follower system between users that allows them to follow each other and see specific content on thier feed page. Once a user on the site clicks the follow button on another user's home page, the posts from the followed user will appear on the feed page. You can follow multiple people and curate your feed page to be the news that you want to read the most.
